# UML--Information-Technology-from-Scratch
I've been playing around with computers for a while, and I've been manifesting ideas over time.
My goal is to create a world-unifying software platform for information technology by creating
it from scratch. I realize this goal is as much political as it is technical, and I'm not sure
how far I'll go with it. It's a pass time. I just thought I'd share my progress with the public
for anyone who might be interested. For a full description of what my approach is, and what I
hope to accomplish, reffer to my project description.
